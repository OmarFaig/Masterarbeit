# 3D-Object Detection Optimization using Sim-to-Real Adaptation for Point Clouds with Neural Networks

Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my master thesis titled "3D-Object Detection Optimization using Sim-to-Real Adaptation for Point Clouds with Neural Networks." The primary goal of this research was to minimize the domain gap between simulated and real-world 3D LiDAR data to optimize the performance of neural network-based 3D object detectors.
